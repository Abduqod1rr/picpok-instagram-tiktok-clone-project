# 📸 PicPok — Post The Real, Not The Filtered

**PicPok** is a bold, minimalistic photo & video sharing platform built with **Django + PostgreSQL**.  
It’s not about fake perfection. It’s about *truth*.  
Raw moments. Real vibes. Unfiltered emotion.  

If TikTok and Instagram had a darker, more authentic sibling — this would be it.
